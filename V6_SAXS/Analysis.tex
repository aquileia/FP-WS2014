We generate $40\,\keV$ x-ray radiation via bremsstrahlung from electrons emitted by a titanate ($\mathsf{TiO_4}$) probe accelerated in a capacitor.

The setup consists of three measurement spots at which x-rays can be applied by opening a shutter for 1 hour (Guinier) or 2 hours (front \& back scattering) respectively.



% Guinier
As the high intensity of the unscattered beam could damage the film, it is only exposed for 3\,s during a pre-measurement to generate a line on the film denoting 0\,\degree. Thereafter, we switch to 'EXP' mode where the central beam is blocked.
