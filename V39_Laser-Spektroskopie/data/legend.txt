 
00 - saturation spectroscopy, overview
01 - absorption spectroscopy, overview
02 - same as 03
03 - saturation spectroscopy, 2nd peak
04 - saturation spectroscopy, 3rd peak
05 - saturation spectroscopy, 3rd peak detail
06 - same as 05
07 - saturation spectroscopy, 4th peak
08 - saturation spectroscopy, 2nd peak detail
09 - saturation spectroscopy, 1st peak
10 - saturation spectroscopy, overview
11 - frequency modulation, 4th peak
12 - same as 11
13 - saturation spectroscopy, 4th peak high resolution
14 - frequency modulation, 3rd peak, no averaging (else we'd lose a dip)
15 - frequency modulation, 1st peak (low amplitude due to limitations of low pass filter: cut off at 2.5MHz while signal is modulated at 0.1MHz, we'd thus need a cut off at 0.2)
16 - frequency modulation, 2nd peak
